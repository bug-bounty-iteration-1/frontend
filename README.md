## Bug Bounty
#### Brief Description
Bug Bounty is application like our own Stack Overflow application, where users/admin can submit Bugs. Admins will be approving, rejecting, or resolving bugs. Users and admins can post solutions for bugs reported by other users/admins and get points for the first correct solution. The solution will be accepted by the user/admin who posted the bug, and resolved by a different admin. The admin who posted a bug cannot approve, reject, you or resolve the bug. 

#### Score Rule
All the bugs will be treated equally and users/admins who offer correct solutions will receive 5 points. When there are multiple solutions for a bug, the solution offered first will receive the score.

#### Bug Status
A bug will change from different statuses. When reported by a user/admin, it will be ‘pending’ until an admin ‘accepts’ or ‘rejects’ it. Users can only view accepted bugs, but admins can view all bugs. A bug can be ‘rejected’ by an admin and will be invisible to all users.

#### Solution, and Bug Resolving Standards
The status of a solution to a bug will be ‘false’ or ‘true’. When a solution is offered by a user/admin, it will be false until the relevant user/admin accepts the solution and updates it to be ‘true’. After a solution is updated true, an admin will mark the relevant bug as ‘resolved’ and the relevant user/admin as a resolver. Then the leadership score board will update automatically when the user/admin is marked as a resolver.

#### What is a Bug?

#### Getting Started
Execute the following command in git to import the project locally.
-	Backend Clone: https://github.com/bug-bounty-iteration-1/bugservice.git
-	Frontend Clone: https://github.com/bug-bounty-iteration-1/frontend.git

To run backend login microservice, execute the following commands:
-	./consul.exe agent -server -bootstrap-expect=1 -data-dir=consul-data -ui -bind= (your computer IPv4
-	Then go to the browser and navigate to  http://localhost:8500/ui to check if the consul is up and running

After the consul is up and running, run the following apps in your IDE.
-	Run ‘loginservice’
-	Run ‘bug-gateway’
-	Run ‘bugservice’  

To run frontend, execute the following commands:
-	Open your preferred IDE and navigate to the folder of the frontend app you have already cloned.
-	Run ‘npm -I’ to install required dependencies.
-	Run ‘ng serve’ from a dev server. 
-	Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Environment and Technologies
* Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Spring, Angular, Protractor, JUnit, TestNG, Jasmine, Jenkins, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Microservices
Architecture
* In the backend, the Bug Bounty application will be a pseudo Microservice Architecture. There will be a ‘loginservice’ Spring Boot Application as a microservice architecture and a ‘bugservice’ Spring Boot Application as a monolithic architecture.
* In the frontend, Angular framework will be used along with Angular Material for a design.

#### Version Control
The GitHub version control was used to manage source codes. Three repos named ‘frontend’ and ‘bugservice’ were used to manage respective source codes..
